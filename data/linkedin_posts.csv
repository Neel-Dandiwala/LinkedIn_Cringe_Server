You're too likely to end up unhealthy, unhappy, divorced and rich. 3) entrepreneurship isn't about new ideas. Don’t follow your passion. Do common things uncommonly well. 4) get married young and have more kids than you can afford. 5) life is sales. Learn to sell or don't expect to earn real money. 6) start small. Trade your time for money. Passive income is a myth in your 20s. 7) decision making is a muscle. The only way to get better is to lift the weight. Books aren't the answer. 8) you get to choose your competition in life. Silicon valley is electing to play basketball against LeBron James. Sweaty startups are playing basketball against a 5th grade girl. The choice is yours. 9) look down the hall. What does it look like to win the game you are about to play? What does your boss look like? Are they happy? That is where you are headed. 10) don't date an emotional abuser. 30% of humans try to get what they want by manipulating other people.

This is short shighted and frankly belies a complete lack of understanding of CEO compensation. https://Inkd.in/geTi7E37 I'd argue that university VCs/presidents are underpaid relative to private sector peers. Moves to slash pay will harm performance by killing incentives. They will also reduce the quality of university leaders as high quality CEO-level leaders will have many outside opportunities that pay more, whether overseas or domestically. In short, the government wants to benchmark VC pay to that of government- department heads. This is stupid. It would result in the CEOs of major enterprises being paid half what they are paid currently. This is well below the private sector. The idea that we should benchmark CEO salaries to government salaries smacks of socialist stupidity. I'll also note that the proposed AUD 600k for a university president is a ridiculously low figure. It's so low that it's absurd. It is not even close to US benchmarks. The UK benchmarks are not appropriate as UK universities routinely underperform US peers.

It's all lies to make themselves look good. As a 31-year-old black, trans, lesbian, and neurodivergent woman, I have not been able to get a single interview in 6 months. If the thousands of companies that claim to support diverse individuals are serious, how come I'm still on a hopeless job hunt? I am literally as intersectionally oppressed as it gets yet companies ignore me. I have my queer, BIPOC, and hidden disability indicators on every version of my resume. So if companies really cared about being inclusive, at least one would have made me an offer by now. Where is their responsibility when they're willing to stand back and watch a multi-minority person fall into poverty? Companies know a person like me can be retraumatized by the constant discrimination I've faced throughout my life, yet they can't even send an email to say they're not interested. They just ghost. Among those companies out there that really do mean it when they say they support DEI, show you're genuine either under this post or in my DMs. I've been ready for a new role for too long, and I know there's a team out there that could benefit from my diverse outlook and skillset.

One thing REALLY stood out to me—just how fat so many people were on average. Old people, middle aged people, young adults, and kids. Every demographic. The percentage of obviously overweight people was astounding. I'm not fat shaming here. It's an objective observation, specifically when comparing this crowd of random people at a hot spring high in the Colorado mountains to the random crowds of people I saw in similar setting across Europe earlier this year. In Europe, you really have to look around to find an obviously overweight person. And funny enough, that person was often an American. I know this post is anecdotal at best. I'm not presenting double blind peer reviewed studies here. Although I'm sure if I dig them up that I'd find plenty of supporting data. But I have a feeling that if Americans more health conscious and more active that our associated cost of healthcare would also be much much lower, and likely on par with averages for other regions around the world. For a small percentage of people, obesity is not a choice.

You? Spouse? Kids? Answer: You. Too often, I've seen people neglect their own needs in the name of love or duty. But here's the truth: if you aren't a priority in your own life, everything else—your mental health, your relationships, your ability to be a better partner, parent, or friend—suffers. You become what I call a “leaf in a hurricane,” tossed around by everyone else's needs, losing your grounding. When you are the priority, you show up as your best self. You have more patience, more empathy, and a deeper capacity to care for others. People may not always realize it, but they benefit most when you put yourself first. So, carve out time each week to be unapologetically “selfish.” Stay true to your habits, discover / nurture your passions, and reconnect with who you are. Learn to love yourself and embrace your full, authentic (and extraordinary) self. Surround yourself with people who want more of you, not less— people who celebrate your growth and authenticity rather than trying to mold you into something you're not. “Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.” -Audre Lorde Prioritize you.

I tackle everyday tasks and learn languages with the help of Al. At some point, my brain couldn't handle the sheer volume of information anymore. However, since I’ve studied neuroscience extensively, I quickly recognized how to push past this level. Through various neuro-exercises, I began developing my brain further. My brain started evolving — and hurting. It’s not my head that hurts; it’s my brain. I think faster, I'm getting smarter, I see things clearly (limitless movie, anyone?), but at the same time, my brain just shuts down and says — error, error, error, reboot the system.

Unbearably cringe. @ Mark Nelson @ @energybants - 2d German utility execs who champion the Energiewende . . . 1 . are starting to panic after this month's shocking 12-day wind drought. RWE CEO Markus Krebber posted a desperate plea f... & Markus Krebber At the beginning of this month, Germany's power supply reached its limits In the evening hours of November 6, the price of electricity rose extremely quickly and extremely sharply - to more than 800 euros per megawatt hour. This made it about ten times more expensive than usual. Then there was a short outcry, but it didn't reverberate for long. Meanwhile, the whole thing was more than just a warning shot. Phases in which wind and sun produce only limited electricity (so-called dark doldrums) are something quite normal - they occur again and again, so we have to be prepared. To ensure stability - the stability of the system as a whole and the stability of the price in particular. After all, these very high prices are an absolutely certain indication of the state of security of supply in Germany. They are the result of the shortage of supply. So let's take a look at the figures from November 6: Demand was around 66 GW. It was covered by domestic production (around 53 GW) and imports (around 13 GW). Almost the entire domestic supply was available (only about 4 GW was not, which is not unusual). In terms of import capacity, only around 3 GW of interconnector capacity was not available (also not unusual). In concrete terms, this means that the same situation would not have been manageable on another day with higher peak load. For example, in January. The highest electricity demand of the year was on 15.01., it was more than 75 GW. And thus almost 10 GW more than on November 6! And in Germany (for years) we have been acting as if the question of adding secured power is something that can be postponed. We can already see very clearly today what happens when power is switched off and no backup is provided for renewables. No, we don't have time anymore, quite the opposite.

Ww w-® Job hopping is the #1 reason I reject resumes. My reason for it is slightly different than David Fallarme's though: I see job hopping as a lack of grit. A job hopper to me is someone who doesn't have the resilience for difficult times, who quits when it gets tough, who is drawn to the ""next shiny object"" too easily, and who always thinks the grass is greener on the other side. After the first 12 months of honeymoon time, when it comes to delivering the real hard stuff, it gets too difficult for them and it's easier to be a newbie somewhere else than to stick it out where you are and actually start delivering for real. No grit, no resilience, no perseverance. And in my experience, those are the three key ingredients to succeed - at work and in life. The second thing job hopping tells me about someone: poor decision making skills. If you're unable to get one of the most important decisions of your life - your career - right, how can I trust you to make decisions for my business? My definition of job hopping: A series of 12-24 months stints (one is fine, even two or three depending on length of work experience).

Go Outside for 15 Minutes Every Morning Get sunlight in your eyes every morning. Sunlight: * Sets your circadium rhythm * Primes your brain to be alert and focused + Enhances metabolism and immune functionality Watch this transform your overall mood and well-being. 2. Surround Yourself With Optimists Who you surround yourself with has a bigger influence on you than you know. You're the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. Each of those 5 should be someone pushing you forward. Choose who you spend your time with wisely. 3. Practice Gratitude Gratitude is a key ingredient for living a fulfilling life. Gratitude helps people: * Feel more positive emotions. * Build strong relationships * Improve their health Take 5 minutes/day to write down 5 things you're grateful for. 4. Set a Bedtime Alarm After this alarm goes off, allow your mind to relax: * Turn off all your devices * Take a warm shower or bath * Read your favorite fiction book Setting yourself up for success the next day starts the night before. 5. Write Every Day Writing is essential in unleashing your creative potential. Writing every day: * Builds discipline + Allows you to organize your thinking * Improves your vocabulary and communication skills Mastering this skill will lead to success in the modern economy. 6. Meditate Daily All of man’s problems come because he cannot sit by himself in a room for 30 minutes. Our society is filled with: * Cheap dopamine * Constant notifications * Screens everywhere we look Take time to slow down and be present. 7. Take a Cold Shower A 3-minute cold shower will provide you benefits that last the rest of the day. Taking a cold shower: + Increases dopamine * Boosts metabolism * Burns brown fat Anything else you have to do afterward will seem easy. 8. Build a Personal Board of Advisors Don’t underestimate the power of a mentor. Epictetus mentored Marcus Aurelius. Jobs mentored Zuckerberg. Buffet mentored Gates.

1gxq54i,Found One!,4,https://i.redd.it/tr6zupzxjk2e1.jpeg,"7:15 Ty Some of you know I have been dealing with a weird, rare chronic pain condition for a few years. I finally decided that “enough is enough,” and rather than continuing to treat the symptoms without addressing the cause (and continuing to bore my loved ones with my constant complaining), I had surgery this week here in St. Louis, where a great specialist practices (I will spare you the gory details of the surgery). I am fine, healing nicely, and full of gratitude for great doctors and for being my own best health advocate. I know sometimes we feel that we can’t share stories of what is happening “behind the scenes” in our lives—because we want to look good, or we worry about seeming needy or oversharing—but sometimes, the stories of our struggles are the ones people need and want to hear. So today, I share this photo and these words to say: many of us want to know your behind the scenes. It helps us to relate, to connect, to understand, and to heal. So, what are you dealing with in your behind the scenes that you might share to create some relief and even help others in doing so? i Ae i poe ge \ N) i ~—, : eeismaee es ey.

Much to my youngest chagrin if we park anywhere like that I don't get a ticket. The rule for her is simple, you have to get a ticket! But in reality it’s a bit more complex than that. The rules actually are : if you park you buy a ticket and if you don't get a ticket you run the risk of getting a fine. And the economist in me knows that a £2.50 ticket is the same as a 1 in 10 chance of getting a £25 fine. That feels counterintuitive but it’s true. So if the odds of getting a ticket are lower than 1 in 10 it is irrational to buy a ticket. My own experimentation (#notadvice) over the last 3 years has convinced me the odds of getting a fine are much lower than 1 in 10 so I don't get a ticket Moral of the story is : it’s always worth checking what the given norms are because you might just find the rules aren't what you think.

1gwuhac,Do you avoid peeing in malls?,62,https://i.redd.it/tsn3t7gehc2e1.jpeg,"- 1st “a OK oogle Marketing I Performance Markete... 23h- © When I was a child, and I absolutely HAD to pee, my dad used to bring me into the men's toilet to use the cubicles there. There would always be a line outside the women's toilet, and neither my parents nor my bladder had the patience to wait. Growing up, my sister and I would often say that the female toilets in the malls would ALWAYS have a line during the weekends. But why? Women take an average of x3 times longer to use the toilet, because of our clothing, physical attributes, and hygiene reasons. Sadly, we can't unzip, do it, and zip it back up. And this is why potty parity is so important. Female toilets, on average, need more space, and more cubicles to amount to the number of urinals and cubicles in the men's. To prevent excess toilet paper wastage, probably more built-in bidets as well, but that's a bonus Do you avoid peeing in malls? €2@ 18 21  m 3 2 c 1   Repost Send",44,0.94

In the evening hours of November 6, the price of electricity rose extremely quickly and extremely sharply - to more than 800 euros per megawatt hour. This made it about ten times more expensive than usual. Then there was a short outcry, but it didn't reverberate for long Meanwhile, the whole thing was more than just a warning shot. Phases in which wind and sun produce only limited electricity (so-called dark doldrums) are something quite normal — they occur again and again, so we have to be prepared. To ensure stability - the stability of the system as a whole and the stability of the price in particular. After all, these very high prices are an absolutely certain indication of the state of security of supply in Germany. They are the result of the shortage of supply. So let's take a look at the figures from November 6: Demand was around 66 GW. It was covered by domestic production (around 53 GW) and imports (around 13 GW). Almost the entire domestic supply was available (only about 4 GW was not, which is not unusual). In terms of import capacity, only around 3 GW of interconnector capacity was not available (also not unusual). In concrete terms, this means that the same situation would not have been manageable on another day with higher peak load. For example, in January. The highest electricity demand of the year was on 15.01., it was more than 75 GW. And thus almost 10 GW more than on November 6! And in Germany (for years) we have been acting as if the question of adding secured power is something that can be postponed. We can already see very clearly today what happens when power is switched off and no backup is provided for renewables No, we don't have time anymore, quite the opposite.

Ona last-minute whim, I decided to host a dinner at my home. I want to do things differently this time around. And one way is to double/triple down on relationships and creating community. I asked my guests to play a game my mom use to play as a child. My mom never drank, partied, or had any fun (from what I could see). But once a year, she hosted all our neighbors and played a game where she'd put questions in a hat to pull that made her guests do everything from answering a vulnerable question to getting on their chair and leading the group in a holiday song. When my mom passed, I promised to honor her through her traditions. There are others! We call the game ""Bobbi's game"" after her. I have carried this on with friends dinners I host over the years, but this is the first time I integrated it into work. There is no doubt my mom was smiling down, watching us belly laugh and cry together. In the pouring rain, not a single person canceled and made the trek from the south bay to several flying in all the way up to Mill Valley. I feel so honored and blessed to call each of you a friend! We feasted (on a 5-star chef meal)! We laughed! We sang! We asked for help! We talked about 'Al' replacing us. We danced! We shared and showed our vulnerable selves. This is just the beginning!

Book travel in advance, but also check with your boss if there might be “add on travel” (Ex: canvassing Chicago when visiting NH) e Flights o Book in advance to save on flights whenever possible but only if your plans are certain o Use carry-on luggage only. o Check ITA Matrix, Kayak, or discount sites for best fares. o Maybe flexible on booking one-way flights if plans might change or there are add on travel e Lodging o Prioritize cheap, safe Airbnbs over hotels unless hotels are cheaper. o  2 bed hotel rooms when possible (Jaime/Slava always do this) o Spend $80-$150/night. $80 if you're in a cheap geo, $150 if you're in NY/Chicago. If driving extra 10 min saves $30/night, drive extra 10 min. o Avoid unsafe or stinky accommodations (sketchy motels / hooker hotels) e Rental Cars & Gas o What's cheaper - rental car, or Lyft/Uber. Do the math in advance. o Get Turo membership in advance. Always check if Turo cheaper than rental cars. o Get the cheapest car that feels safe. (If mid size is $2/more than compact, get mid size) o Fill gas at cheaper stations far from airport, avoiding airport-adjacent prices. e Food o Keep meals basic, healthy, and affordable. o Jaime/Slava do groceries for breakfast/lunch. Even in the hotel room o Dinner options like Chipotle, Whole Foods Buffet, or local taco places. We rarely spend more than $20/meal unless with partners /client. Alcohol isn’t covered because alcohol is poison your body doesn't need. o If eating lunch out, Lunch budget: ~$15 max. e Transportation o Use public transit if it's efficient (not 2X slower). o Compare Uber/Lyft prices before booking. Do Carpool if it saves money. e Expense Report o Email your boss an expense report when done. Make it quick and easy Good Harbor, LLC I 6 Liberty Sq #909, Boston, MA 02109 I 617.564.3001",309,0.97

My anti-grocery store lifestyle began my junior year of college. I was allowed 1 free grocery haul from my parents per semester. I then scouted out every free food opportunity on campus - and went to most of events! I was a bit worried about free food opportunities in Chicago, but surprisingly, there is a lot of free stuff in the city - if you know where to look. aap: Tips for Finding Free Food 1.

I make sure to set reminders/calender events so I don’t miss out! 2. Perks of the Job {.) I am lucky enough to have a job where I travel quite a bit, so I am able to stay afloat with work-expensed meals. Yay work trips! Yay work snacks! 3. Always Have a Container @ I always have plastic bags/containers with me. You never know when there will be leftovers in the common area of the WeWork ® 4. Don't Be Afraid to Ask J. I have shamelessly asked for leftover food after various events. Otherwise it’s going to waste! 5. Sometimes You Just Get Lucky % One time my Uber driver gave me a box of crackers (they were sealed and unopened). Another time I was walking past a restaurant that was giving out free meals for their soft opening (I ate there for breakfast, came back for dinner, then had breakfast again the next day...) 6.

Why? For one, because you are calling companies “liars” for saying something that is nota lie, It is fine that you don't “like what remote means in this capacity. You don't have to. But to outright call companies ""liars"" could very well imply that you are a troublemaker where no kind of real trouble exists. You are essentially calling them liars when they are not lying.

You've already shown how you handle something you don't like, and that is to defame.

Someone was interested in career coaching with me... but then passed because she saw my “open to work"" banner was on. Excuse me? What does that have to do with anything!? Yeah, I had a corporate job. I got paid a lot of money to hire people. Then the company hit a rough patch and starting doing lots of layoffs. I’m still really good at what I do. I'm to another corporate job but it would have to make sense. Why are you judging me for having a green banner on? LinkedIn doesn’t make an “open to clients” banner or I'd use that. This outdated mentality smells of, “You can't afford a house because you order avocado fof toast.” You should hire me because I've hired hundreds of people and have reviewed 200,000 more LinkedIn profiles than you have. I've seen tens of thousands of resumes. I know what companies want and how to get hired. Let’s keep an open mind about people.

It started with him saying ""I love you Daddy."" I was busy answering emails so I got ChatGPT to respond for me. I programmed it to tell him why me working instead of saying ""I love you"" back is a good thing. Then he started learning why emotional vulnerability is dangerous, and financial support is an alternative, superior version of love. ChatGPT started training him not to feel love, but ambition. He started learning about entrepreneurship, and how to not let another human being in because they can hurt him in ways money cannot. I think this is going to be revolutionary. ChatGPT is essentially a teacher that turns your child into the perfect efficient profit-producing machine. He hasn't said ""I love you"" since. And I could get all my emails done.

EZ,2,https://i.redd.it/etsw14wfcx1e1.png,"<p ocermaies! a + Follow 6d « » © Nobody pays more taxes than high W-2 employees But there are still lots of great planning moves they can use to pay less in taxes: 1.) 401(k) at work. Do the full $23K as pre-tax and get the employer match. Then see if your company allows the mega backdoor Roth to get up to the $69K/year limit 2.) Backdoor Roth to shelter another $7K/year or $14K/year if married. Just watch out for the pro rata rule 3,) Tax efficient investing. Put the right investments in the right accounts to save on taxes. Example: Put your most aggressive stuff in Roth accounts, like Tesla or Bitcoin. Also, if you live in a state with high state taxes, ditch the HYSA and put cash reserves in a money market fund with US treasuries so the interest is tax-free on the state level 4) Tax loss harvesting if you have a large brokerage account. This alone can increase your after-tax returns by 1% a year 5.) HSA if you have a high deductible health plan. It is the best account out there for high earners. Example: Every dollar somebody in the 32% tax bracket puts in is a 39.65% return (32% deduction and 7.65% pre-FICA) plus funds can be grown/spent tax-free 6.) Use a donor-advised fund to donate appreciated assets to charity (instead of cash). This donates the capital gains taxes you'd owe and donations can also be ""bunched"" for a nice tax savings 7,) Running a short-term rental business on the side. It is one of the few ways somebody can offset W-2 income but the qualifying rules are tough. Make sure you look into the qualifying rules to do this right 8.) Marry a real estate professional. Getting real estate professional status is almost impossible with a full-time W-2 but a spouse can qualify and depreciation on real estate can be used to offset active W-2 income 9.) Start a side hustle. Owning a business opens up a world of benefits but it must be real and legit. Not just an LLC that loses money every single year. Many people I work with have consulting income for $20K - $30K and this is a wonderful way to save on taxes, get more into retirement accounts, deduct expenses, etc BGR 144 42 cammante«Aranncte",2,0.75

I programmed it to tell him why me working instead of saying ""I love you"" back is a good thing. Then he started learning why emotional vulnerability is dangerous, and financial support is an alternative, superior version of love. ChatGPT started training him not to feel love, but ambition. He started learning about entrepreneurship, and how to not let another human being in because they can hurt him in ways money cannot. I think this is going to be revolutionary.

Here's how it made me feel: Uncomfortable. It didn’t match my relaxed vibe and tbh I was afraid I'd bump into something and scratch it. My nervous system just isn’t used to holding the weight - both physical and symbolic - of something that valuable on my wrist. But it got me thinking about how often we put ourselves in intimidating and challenging situations that feel similar to how I felt with that Rolex on. I remember the first time I moved from a Mid-Market rep to an Enterprise rep at Microsoft. I was the youngest rep on my team by about 15 years and I found myself working on 8-figure deals with executive leadership breathing down my neck. was terrified. But the thing is, after about 6 months of being in this role, it became more “normalized” in my system. My capacity expanded because I kept showing up, stretching into that bigger identity. The same thing happened when I threw my first 3-day in-person immersion for 20 reps and leaders. I was scared out of my mind, wondering if I'd even be able to pull it off. Now, after 9 successful immersions, I'm starting to feel a shift. My identity is catching up to the version of myself I'd been too nervous to claim before. Here's the truth: Every time we step into a new role, put ourselves in an unfamiliar situation, or take on responsibilities we've never held before, we're expanding our capacity. It feels awkward, uncomfortable, and at times, outright terrifying. But the more you do it, the more you grow. To hold more, you have to be more. And that means leaning into the discomfort, welcoming the unknown, and giving yourself permission to grow into each new level. So, whether it's a $50,000 watch or a 8-figure opportunity, put yourself in situations that require you to level up. The discomfort won't last forever, but the growth will. CC@ 158 25",0,1.0

At the risk of ruffling some feathers, I'd advise against saying this. Here’s why: 1. That's way too many steps down the road. To become judge, you first need to become a really good attorney. Come back down to earth and focus on that for about twenty years, then we can talk. 2. It sounds presumptuous to tell practicing lawyers you want to be the guy deciding their cases when you don’t even know how to litigate a case yet. It’s like telling someone who's interviewing you that you want to be their boss. 3. It strikes me as a bit of ared flag. Judges have an awesome responsibility and enjoy a level of prestige and deference (too much, arguably) that’s unheard of anywhere else in the legal profession. I'm a little suspicious when people say they want some prestigious position at a stage where they probably don’t know much about that position other than that it’s prestigious. To that point... 4. You don't actually know what it's like to be a judge. If you want to know more, a great way is to spend a year or two as a law clerk after graduation.

All these issues boils down to how we define and understand Sex A lot of times when people say Sex, they mean p*nis and vag!na Sex and that is called inter-cOurse. So this means, for Sex to happen, inter-cOurse must happen. This is the root cause of all Sexual problems If we redefine Sex as I do in my professional practice as a Sex coach and in my personal Sex life with my husband, most of these problems will be solved. So how do we redefine Sex When I say Sex, I am talking about any experience with your partner that increases the intimacy and brings pleasure. This could be: Touching FOreplay Oral X Inter-cOurse It doesn't even have to involve an Orgasm. Sex is just any interaction that brings you and your partner pleasure Intimacy is so important in a relationship because it helps us to increase our bond with our partner and it differentiates the other relationships that we have in our life like our friends, colleagues, parents, from the relationship we have with our romantic partner.

As a hiring manager my job is to ensure each hire has a very high likelihood of achieving the required outcomes of the role. That means screening out candidates with red flags that reduce that likelihood. Here are the top reasons for gaps, why they are red flags, and suggestions on avoiding them. 1. Laid-off/terminated/resigned without gainful employment for 3-4 months. This indicates your actively looking and other employers have screened and interviewed you and you keep getting rejected. This could mean you have unreasonable asks or are applying to jobs you are unqualified for. MITIGATION: Take any role, even a contractor role, and continue to look for your forever job. 2. Formal education gaps. This indicates you are looking for a significant change in your role and do not have the requisite experience to perform the role or the tenacity to work and go to school full time. MITIGATION: Going to school on nights and weekends will turn this from a liability into a strength. 3. Personal/family issues. These are unavoidable but an employer is concerned that the same issue can represent itself again. MITIGATION: Explain the situation and why it will not be a problem moving forward. If the problem still exists you will need to consider more flexible roles like a contractor. 5. Sabbatical. Don't do this. Unless you are a founder/CEO with a well established personal brand no one will buy this. It's been studied that most employees are fully recharged after a 10-21 day vacation.

I had a long flight ahead and a grand plan to get through my emails and several have-baked projects that I was excited to knock out. But instead? I boarded a plan with a half charged phone and a whole lot of nothing to do but sit with my thoughts (UGH). To be clear, I'm aware this is a ""first world problem"" and I recognize the privilege to complain about something this petty. But, I also know that I'm not alone in the ""I must be productive at all times"" club. If you're like me, and the idea of unplanned downtime and sitting still on a plane panics you---you get it. After I landed, I took a trip to the Apple store and today, I type away on a loaner while they attempt to fix my old BFF. While I wait for my laptop's possible resurrection, I can't help but think that maybe the universe was sending me a gentle reminder to just be still? Now I'm curious- how do you handle unexpected downtime and tech fails ""in the wild?"" Do you embrace it or scramble to fill the void or do you hava tinc far tha ractlacc?",8,1.0

Well here it is. Totally fake. No doctor visit required. Just answered some questions and here is the note. So, no, this “doctor” did not “evaluate” Paul Knight as stated.

If I have many deadlines at the same time, I will work more efficiently and finish much more work in the same amount of time. We need to change our perception about stress. Nobody in this world became successful without taking some stress. In most cases, a lot of stress is self-inflicted, especially when they want to give their best and improve their performance. As long as the stress does not consume them, it will generally lead to increased efficiency. You don't have to be super smart to become successful.

Sadly, it was anything but. My seat was broken (it wouldn't recline), my seat area was a bit dirty and scuffed, and they were out of my chosen meal. But the real kicker? A fellow passenger sporting a ""woman"" t-shirt. Most trans people are aware this is a transphobic dog whistle (insinuating that this person is a REAL woman, and that trans women aren't women). Discovering this TERF passenger just a few seats away caused me to have a panic attack mid-flight. I'm used to getting hate online, and was caught off-guard IRL. & I wasn't expecting to have to share a cabin with someone who doesn't feel that trans people have the right to exist. I walked up to 'behind the curtain' and spoke with a member of cabin crew, Sharon, who was incredibly supportive and checked on me a few times throughout the flight. This incident highlighted a gap in airline policies. While airlines can't police every outfit, fostering an inclusive environment is crucial. Perhaps some guidelines on potentially offensive clothing could prevent similar situations? This experience reminded me that ""Upper Class"" shouldn't just be about fancy seats and champagne. It should be about respect, inclusivity, and ensuring ALL passengers feel safe and welcome. I'm hoping that Virgin Atlantic will I take this opportunity to continue to improve (I helped consult on their gender neutral uniform campaign, which was amazing) and create a truly Upper Class experience for everyone.

In 2017, at the age of 50, I quit an Executive Vice President (OFK) job at BMW to manage a small shop within SpaceX that produced tubes. I left behind the most sought after lifetime appointment within BMW for a tiny apartment and a make-shift desk on the shop floor next to an oily pre-war Pines tube bender at a then unknown company. People thought I was crazy giving up such a coveted position, but I felt under valued and pushed out by new leadership at BMW and I just wanted to be in the game and not sit on the sidelines. I was captivated by the mission at SpaceX (to make humans multi-planetary) and the enthusiasm of its people; I wanted to play for this team. Within a couple years, I became the VP of Production and Launch for Falcon and Dragon. My job was to help SpaceX scale operations, normalize space flight, and replace myself with people far more talented than me (the people that will take us to Mars). I’m happy to report, mission accomplished. As a bonus, I got to be part of the early days of Starbase and Starship production (sleeping on the floor of an abandon house my very first trip and experiencing what hardcore SpaceX was all about - I loved it!). I supported Starlink and Starshield production and got a pretty deep look into every SpaceX location across the US. Through it all, I've been humbled by the endless amount of talented people we have at this company. In 2020, I was part of the leadership team that put Americans back in space on an American spacecraft for the first time since the Shuttle was retired in 2010. I got to know the true meaning of stress each time we launched astronauts into space (we launched over 30 astronauts into space while I was VP of Production and Launch; including the first private astronauts). I'm not the smartest person, but let me assure you it’s never too late to continue learning and challenging yourself. I'ma better person as a result of this journey and very thankful to my wife and kids for their support - I spent many nights away from home and I know it wasn't always easy. Now it's time to focus on them. So, thanks to Elon and Gwynne for believing in me and thanks to the entire team for listening to my stories and teaching me what it means to be maniacally mission oriented. I know you will be successful and I’m forever humbled to have had the opportunity to be a small part of history. Always remember: go safely, go reliably, and Go SpaceX! And, GO step out of your comfort zone, take a risk, and change the world. Rich Robert Palin and 866 others 51  * 5 reposts",0,0.86

It dives into a defense strategy that broke new ground by using “battered woman's syndrome” to describe the trauma of sexual abuse of men. The approach led to a hung jury, prompting the world to break down past stereotypes and dogmas. In the retrial, the prosecution blocked evidence of abuse, reducing the case to a black-and-white, fact- based hearing. The brothers admitted to the killings, but without the abuse angle, complexities disappeared. That got me thinking about Al and hallucinations. We can lock down Al, restricting it to past assumptions, and that would eliminate inaccuracies. But part of the weird and wonderful usefulness of Al is its ability to stumble upon the unique and innovative, tying disparate ideas to one another and finding new paths of logic and reasoning to open one's mind and change the world.",4,0.96

A 6 hour journey that cracked open a door to the depths of myself. What I thought would be a single experience turned into the beginning of something far more profound. In that moment, as my ego dissolved, I felt as if I were peeling an onion. Each layer revealed another, deeper one beneath it, and I realized there were pieces of me I'd never fully seen. It was humbling and terrifying. But it was also the most profound thing I'd ever done. Since then, I’ve kept exploring my mind. This mind journey has no syllabus, no “end point.” Unlike learning an instrument, there’s no final mastery here. There's only acceptance—that I'll never fully “arrive.” I'm learning to let go of the need to reach a destination. Instead, I've come to value practicing mindfulness.

But what most people don't know, is that internships are also net negative for the student. Even before Day 1, you've already established yourself as someone who creates a loss for the organization. You've wasted a lot of time and money, between your interviews, laptop and equipment, benefits, etc. As the internship progresses, you'll only continue to bleed the company dry - wasting colleagues’ time and money (under the guise of mentorship), your salary, etc. A good rule for life: Always think about the shareholders. How can you ever expect to be a 10x engineer, when you're a -10x engineer on day 1? I famously quit my last role because I was asked to mentor an intern. The only person who actually needed mentorship was my manager, who believed that interns were useful. The industry was better when interns’ only role was to get us coffee. For anyone reading who is seriously interested in career development, focus on leveling up the corporate ladder. For those of you who still want to do internships, I like 4 creams, 3 sugars. #Interns #Internships #InternshipsAreAWaste #GetMeCoffeelnstead #4Creams3Sugars #StopHiringInterns #LevelUpInstead",16,0.91

So when I took a half-day yesterday it was important to share an update with my team to describe how the rest of my day went... WBR-style. On 31-October, the Luttrell family reported a candy collection total of 13.3 pounds. This represents a 1.8 pound decrease YoY, and a miss on the 2024 collection goal of 15 pounds. Contributing factors of the deliverable miss include: 1/ warmer than expected temperatures [78F] during peak collection period, 2/ an extended parental stop at a friends house for cold-beverages, and 3/ a missed daily nap from our youngest associate (Baby Yoda, see image). The overnight review revealed an average of 9.5 empty wrappers per associate, parents will deep dive to determine the root cause of this greater than expected stock loss. Next steps: For 2025 we will increase the collection goal to of 17.5 pounds. To achieve this we will: 1/ spend 11-months discussing which costumes associates will wear, with a final decision expected the morning of 31-Oct-2025. 2/ place Baby Yoda in the path to promotion so she can graduate from stroller confinement to full door knocking associate.

My social media was full of exclusive parties, luxury getaways, and VIP events. /! @ My boss was completely baffled. He’d scroll through my posts, wondering, “How is my employee richer than me?” And he thought I was really cool and wanted to befriend me. Before long, he started sucking up to me, always nice, consulting me on every decision like I was some kind of oracle. @I'd throw him just enough scraps of attention to keep him eager, always letting him believe he was this close to being in my world. But he never quite made it. B And just like that, the power dynamic flipped. He bumped my salary, threw in perks, and treated me as the “real” authority around the office.

(regardless of who you voted for) America recently conducted it's big ""job search"" for President and it was an unusual search to say the least. But, there are definitely things we can learn from it @ So, here are 3 takeaways (about job searching) from the results: (1) TIMING (REALLY) MATTERS Trump had a distinct advantage in this election in that he was the Republican candidate from the beginning. He was an ""early applicant"" so to speak. @ When it comes to job search, timing really matters. According to a recent study, 85% of job seekers who land interviews applied within the first 24-48 hours of the job being posted. 7 (2) CONNECTION MATTERS While Kamala focused her campaign on her qualifications, Trump focused most of his on connecting with his followers. Most job candidates tend to focus way too much on their qualifications and forget the golden rule: people hire people they like. @ You should spend 70% of your interviews building connection and only 30% on demonstrating you're qualified. 7 (3) THE COMPETITION MATTERS Kamala is a very qualified and capable politician, but that's not always enough. One of the keys to winning a job is understanding who you're competing with. Polling data showed that when Kamala started attacking Trump, she actually started losing ground. @ It can be tempting to bash your previous employer, coworkers, or manager, but typically that will hurt your chances rather than help them. ...Personally I was not a fan of this election and didn't like either candidate we were given. Regardless of who you supported though, one thing is for sure: we can learn from this very public job search and (hopefully) improve our own. P.S.

Let me explain: 1. Birkins taught me about the power of exclusivity There's a reason Birkins aren't mass-produced: you can’t even go into a store and purchase it on a whim. Doing this allows Hermés to price their products at a much higher price point and creates artificial demand. SaaS companies can leverage exclusivity through customer onboarding, beta features, or premium support. This can create a sense of privilege and foster greater commitment from clients. When customers feel they're part of something unique, they'll champion your product. A great example of this is Build Club by Annie Liao ** with a waitlist for early access, creating even more hype for the product. 2. Birkins taught me the importance of understanding your key customer Hermés understands what their customers value. The birkin was created after a Hermes’ executive sat next to Jane Birkin on a plane who was complaining that she wished there was a tote that could hold more things - and the birkin was born. Similarly, in B2B SaaS, building a product that solves a specific problem deeply and effectively is better than trying to cover everythina. If you try to appeal to everyone, you'll",9,0.89

He mentioned he's making $800 a month, mostly from the kindness of strangers, to make rent (controlled at $275/mo). He had mentioned this with incredible gratitude for the people of SF always being there for him. He has never felt in lack. I was in awe. His mindset was extraordinarily resilient, positive, and community-oriented. He then explained to me his purpose: he took pride in protecting the streets of SF for its citizens (he even was protective of me when various folks would approach - it was still dark out).

But if we take the time to analyze the problem and the situation, the solution is obvious: the two poles are 0 m apart.

This is a really tough spot to be in. Makes $2k a month more than he spends every month. Zero chance at long term wealth but too easy and profitable to leave. Golden handcuffs.

It's hard to get excited about scraping and fixing toilets or power washing sidewalks when you make $75 an hour at your day job. And it’s impossible to feel comfortable buying a company if you don't start out lower and work your way up (with stuff that isn’t exciting when you get a taste of decent money). Difficult stuff.

Challenge the norm. Beg to differ. Speak up. Who stand up for the right thing for the company. For the clients. NOT for what they think is best for their career! In general, managers are afraid of these people. But they actually should listen to what they have to say. As well as encourage a culture of healthy dissent.

In a mentoring session this week, a very promising product leader asked some questions that led to a conversation about effective communication in an executive setting. I find this to be a key element of executive presence. The principle I shared goes back to a math class I had in high school. The concept was evaluating mathematical functions as they approach infinity. I know - you're wondering what this has to do with executive communication. Take for example f(n) = n*3 + 5. As n approaches infinity 5 becomes irrelevant. a I apply this same thought process to communications. Especially when trying to align an executive team. In most decisions, there are only a handful of relevant points that really drive the outcome. Everything else just creates surface area for rat holes and confusion. As a VP of Products ok on the challenge of getting the executive team aligned on a decision to end of life a product. There was a long line of people before me that had tried to get alignment on this same decision. I reviewed the past proposals and saw that every potential angle had been researched and shared with the executive team. There was no lack of data to support the decision. There was a lack of clarity about what was important in making the decision. I created two slides to focus the conversation and put everything else in the appendix. I effectively isolated the portion of the function that mattered as the problem approached infinity. We were able to get aligned and never went past the second slide (into the appendix). On a side note, I really like math. It is just fun. I'm one of those straight A's in math people so perhaps this example skews more toward the mathematically inclined.",10,0.69

We were in a heavily regulated industry and code changes were monitored by both our internal compliance department and random checks from external auditors. Deleting the boobs meant putting your name on the code change and no one wanted to take the risk of having to explain why there had been ascii boobs in the codebase. There were no questions asked about things that didn't change. So the boobs stayed for years and years. Almost every codebase has areas that embarrass developers and the company. They persist because tackling them requires admitting that problems have existed for years and you've been ignoring them.

If I knew deep down he was not prepared I wouldn't have asked him to quit to pursue his dreams. Keep in mind. Over the past 4 years, I soent hundreds of hours training him and invested a lot into his career. At the end of the day do I consider building an employee up and encouraging them to pursue their dreams a loss on my end? Of course not. It's a huge win.

As a finance influencer who built his career around financial education, the irony isn't lost on me :) So let me give you guys an update- it's been a while. Business update: We are currently doing around $8Mn of annualised revenue with a 35-40% EBITDA. And yes, we have a fancy 5000 saft office in Mumbai but all of this was done with company’s profits. Our investor's money of 210 Crores is currently invested in an FD earning 8.5% interest :) We have almost 85,000 active paying customers and are working on new financial products and services some of which are already launched and have also achieved profitability. So why did we layoff? I started this company from my bedroom with just 5 interns 2 years back and fast forward today we have almost 200 employees. Needless to say, when you grow at such lightening speed you are bound to make some mistakes with hiring and redundant expenses. This is our first cost cutting excercise since inception. We have identified significant Al driven cost savings that can boost profitability and efficiency which can be reinvested in the business growth. Raghav Gupta and I have been running this company bootstrapped without ever using investor capital because we are super strict with our financial planning and diligence. While I don the hat of a capitalistic businessman continually growing the company I also realise the psychological impact on the laid off employees.

Lile mirrors this dance—pushed down by weight and pressure, we rise again, tempered by struggle and ignited by determination. It is not in the ease but in the resistance thal strength is born.

People tell the truth: In the voting booth. With their wallet. In the bedroom. But they don’t always tell the truth with their mouths. This is especially true for women who use shame to keep each other in line, while the left thinks they hold the monopoly on virtue. (ust check out the flood of posts from ‘dismayed’ women still rolling in.) Women are drawn to men who speak their minds because: They can relax. They can open up. They can have fun. They know you'll call out the BS. They know you'll stand up for them. But this isn’t about the election, (Although Trump increased the female vote share). And it’s not about attraction, (Though that's where you see the real archetype for sales). It’s about guys losing—like Harris—because they can't. Speak the truth. Get to the truth. Push back on the bullsh*t. If you're too nice to speak the truth, you're too nice to win. In relationships. In sales. In life. Tired of not getting what you want?

So many smart people have been weighing in (and will continue to weigh in) on why and how this happened. And they almost always ask the same question: what were people thinking? It's a valid question. I ask it myself. What the hell were people thinking, voting for someone who promises mass deportation of immigrants and hyper-inflationary tariffs? Voting for someone who wants to use the military against the populace? Voting for someone who openly fantasizes about imprisoning his critics? Voting for a convicted felon? But ultimately, it's the wrong question to ask, because a lot of people just weren't thinking. They acted on their feelings. Sure, their feelings were likely dark, nasty lizard-brain feelings. But feelings nonetheless. Because when it comes to persuasion, how people feel is always going to be far more important than what people think.

",3,https://i.redd.it/cwszti23pezd1.png,"& Ajai Krishna Singh. ist Business Analyst I IT Business Analysis I SaaS I Agile I Scrum I UX I ... ri O 21h-® I recently came across posts and discussions highlighting how some beggars in India reportedly earn up to 200,000 per month—more than many MNC employees. A beggar in Mumbai is even said to have a net worth of 27.5 crore. Let's analyze this phenomenon a bit deeper. Begging may not seem like a ""job"" to some, and it might even appear demeaning, but in many ways, it requires a sophisticated sales strategy. Here's how: Many people overlook the fact that, while begging is a one-way transaction (often considered charity without tax benefits), it involves a powerful exchange. When people give money or goods to beggars, they often receive blessings in return. For example, blessings for health, longevity, or happiness are frequently given—creating a form of non-tangible transaction. These blessings make some people feel a sense of satisfaction, as if they're helping someone in need. This feeling releases dopamine, the same hormone associated with pleasure responses from actions like enjoying a favorite meal, scrolling through Instagram, or even taking a puff of a cigarette. These are all behaviors that support multi-billion dollar industries, fueled by the same reward mechanism. Additionally, these blessings offer a sense of security in a world full of uncertainties. When beggars say, “May you live a long life” or “May your relationship thrive,” it resonates with people similarly to how companies market products. Think of refined oil brands with slogans like ""Healthy Heart,’ or insurance companies warning about the importance of securing your family’s future. The strategy taps into human emotions and the need for reassurance. Furthermore, children begging on the streets evoke sympathy, prompting people to give even more generously. This, too, can be seen as a calculated approach that effectively drives donations. In conclusion, begging is not merely an act of asking for help—it’s a well-thought-out marketing and sales strategy in itself.",3,1.0

Visit my website 12h- ® I just laid off 15% of my workforce and I received a lot of messages from my friends and media if I’m going bankrupt. As a finance influencer who built his career around financial education, the irony isn't lost on me :) So let me give you guys an update- it’s been a while. Business update: We are currently doing around $8Mn of annualised revenue with a 35-40% EBITDA. And yes, we have a fancy 5000 saft office in Mumbai but all of this was done with company's profits. Our investor's money of 210 Crores is currently invested in an FD earning 8.5% interest :) We have almost 85,000 active paying customers and are working on new financial products and services some of which are already launched and have also achieved profitability. So why did we layoff? I started this company from my bedroom with just 5 interns 2 years back and fast forward today we have almost 200 employees. Needless to say, when you grow at such lightening speed you are bound to make some mistakes with hiring and redundant expenses. This is our first cost cutting excercise since inception. We have identified significant Al driven cost savings that can boost profitability and efficiency which can be reinvested in the business growth. Raghav Gupta and I have been running this company bootstrapped without ever using investor capital because we are super strict with our financial planning and diligence. While I don the hat of a capitalistic businessman continually growing the company I also realise the psychological impact on the laid off employees. Please note that we have offered a healthy severance package ie Al ie TK bbheomn Bas re be all Shack Lael welt we ex ll aicanne",2,0.67

No, of course not. Personal inate selection is important for genetic complement, but anti-natalist feminist culture has severely broken society's sustainability.

I've seen this personally. Giving up your USP actually reduces your value to society, and given the average woman is a serious fiscal net loss to the state, the fix may be to change the incentives such as revoking state pensions for people who do not have children, as they are just cheating society by taxing other people's children more heavily or digging the society into national debt, which isn't fair on people who did the right thing in life.",182,0.94

(I'm not joking.) I spoke to several early career professionals in the last few weeks who asked me for tips on succeeding in investment banking. Banking taught me invaluable lessons and set me up for success in future roles. But if I could go back in time, here's what I'd do differently: Have a strong “why”. Want to be an investor or in corporate finance? Great. If not, consider consulting or high-growth startups for accelerated learning and ample exit opportunities. Start early with a good cohort. Recruit in school if possible. Having an Analyst or Associate class to share late nights and commiserate with is crucial. Build those relationships. Choose the team, not the bank. Each investment banking division is its own world. Get coffee with Associates/Analysts to find teams with better hours, interesting work, and reasonable managers. Position yourself in those teams, and you might even want to be a career banker. a I Ensure your personal life supports banking. My partner at the time didn't get why I couldn't ""just say no,"" and my 9-to-5 friends couldn't relate. Pair that with poor diet and fitness habits, and I was set up for failure.

The fact is, the weather, almost everywhere, is good most of the time. Or at least, it's appropriate for the season. Hurricanes, blizzards, torrential rains, droughts and tornadoes happen occasionally. And this has been true since before recorded history. It wasn't until politicians figured out that they could monetize bad weather with a campaign of fear, that bad weather became “our fault.” \\ ( Vi Ze j Gi’ SA ‘ Pe rs \j i, ee = => SS — y iio AS 5 s, fe ‘ Wi, = cS ae WS iA UA, oye i = Z a = t =H Hin Sa YS ie: ee f Re AAW \ * , = A ay al GN jo AS ane i] A i I ee ee. ll. eet—‘ RYS®Y a — rh ‘ 4 A",3,0.88
