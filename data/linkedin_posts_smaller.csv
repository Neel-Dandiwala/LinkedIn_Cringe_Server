You're too likely to end up unhealthy, unhappy, divorced and rich. 3) entrepreneurship isn't about new ideas. Don’t follow your passion. Do common things uncommonly well. 4) get married young and have more kids than you can afford. 5) life is sales. Learn to sell or don't expect to earn real money. 6) start small. Trade your time for money. Passive income is a myth in your 20s. 7) decision making is a muscle. The only way to get better is to lift the weight. Books aren't the answer. 8) you get to choose your competition in life. Silicon valley is electing to play basketball against LeBron James. Sweaty startups are playing basketball against a 5th grade girl. The choice is yours. 9) look down the hall. What does it look like to win the game you are about to play? What does your boss look like? Are they happy? That is where you are headed. 10) don't date an emotional abuser. 30% of humans try to get what they want by manipulating other people.

This is short shighted and frankly belies a complete lack of understanding of CEO compensation. https://Inkd.in/geTi7E37 I'd argue that university VCs/presidents are underpaid relative to private sector peers. Moves to slash pay will harm performance by killing incentives. They will also reduce the quality of university leaders as high quality CEO-level leaders will have many outside opportunities that pay more, whether overseas or domestically. In short, the government wants to benchmark VC pay to that of government- department heads. This is stupid. It would result in the CEOs of major enterprises being paid half what they are paid currently. This is well below the private sector. The idea that we should benchmark CEO salaries to government salaries smacks of socialist stupidity. I'll also note that the proposed AUD 600k for a university president is a ridiculously low figure. It's so low that it's absurd. It is not even close to US benchmarks. The UK benchmarks are not appropriate as UK universities routinely underperform US peers.

Not sure how to caption this one. ,131,https://i.redd.it/sap2cvv0hv2e1.png,"Kasandra Chapman eee 12+ years in HR I Open to my next adventure Companies talk about DEI, gender equality & inclusivity, and corporate social responsibility but I am living proof that they don't care. It's all lies to make themselves look good. As a 31-year-old black, trans, lesbian, and neurodivergent woman, I have not been able to get a single interview in 6 months. If the thousands of companies that claim to support diverse individuals are serious, how come I'm still on a hopeless job hunt? I am literally as intersectionally oppressed as it gets yet companies ignore me. I have my queer, BIPOC, and hidden disability indicators on every version of my resume. So if companies really cared about being inclusive, at least one would have made me an offer by now. Where is their responsibility when they're willing to stand back and watch a multi-minority person fall into poverty? Companies know a person like me can be retraumatized by the constant discrimination I've faced throughout my life, yet they can't even send an email to say they're not interested. They just ghost. Among those companies out there that really do mean it when they say they support DEI, show you're genuine either under this post or in my DMs. I've been ready for a new role for too long, and I know there's a team out there that could benefit from my diverse outlook and skillset. Hopefully the hypocrisy ends soon, but I'm not holding my breath. Sooner or later we will have to name and shame! Pls share for reach.",107,0.83

Irish boxer “Conor McGregor"" says about his wife! ""We have been together for 8 years and we live in Ireland, 30 miles from Dublin, in a rented apartment without work. I didn't work because I spent all my time training. It's always been my dream to be a hero. She believed in me and despite the lack of money, I made an effort to take care of my diet, and I had to eat athlete's food and respectable food. She always took care of me and encouraged me. When I came home from an intense workout, no energy and tired, she would always tell me, “Conor McGregor, I know you can do this and it will work.” And now I make millions of dollars fighting in matches with between 50 and 70 thousand spectators. Now I can buy any car, any clothes, any house and yet she didn't ask me for anything, but she deserves the best in this world. She is always by my side and tells me that I can do anything! I got to this place because of her, she never gave up on me and she never left me alone. Conor McGregor. The lesson: A man's success in his life is behind a woman who is his life.

I have a very high tolerance for bad service, but the way Maybank has treated me as a long-term customer so far has really hit my nerves. Backstory: Irequested a replacement debit card last month due to suspected fraudulent charges and I haven't received my card yet. Numerous follow-ups with customer service on the phone were often ended with promises such as “Oh only X more days”. X days passed and further follow-ups on the phone with more empty promises, ""X more days"", ""X more days”. Hey Maybank, it has been a month, and my last call with customer service in the morning was answered: ""Sorry, it could have been a return mail, and you'll need to re-apply again.” Woah, seriously? Wow! What service! Ok fine, could I then collect the card in-person then? More promises of the expedition is again met with more silence. Seriously, please buck up. As a customer, am I expected to follow up with your broken processes? Sorry, I don't have the luxury of time to manage and follow-up repeatedly with broken promises. I am not your manager, I am your customer. Maybank #badservice #frustration 6637 10",2,1

One thing REALLY stood out to me—just how fat so many people were on average. Old people, middle aged people, young adults, and kids. Every demographic. The percentage of obviously overweight people was astounding. I'm not fat shaming here. It's an objective observation, specifically when comparing this crowd of random people at a hot spring high in the Colorado mountains to the random crowds of people I saw in similar setting across Europe earlier this year. In Europe, you really have to look around to find an obviously overweight person. And funny enough, that person was often an American. I know this post is anecdotal at best. I'm not presenting double blind peer reviewed studies here. Although I'm sure if I dig them up that I'd find plenty of supporting data. But I have a feeling that if Americans more health conscious and more active that our associated cost of healthcare would also be much much lower, and likely on par with averages for other regions around the world. For a small percentage of people, obesity is not a choice. For most of the rest of though......it’s a result of lifestyle choices. ag Siem si ABO un , . ne 7 ea <* ~ : <i ‘ a4 f ) ‘ ' Ns H 3 4s parm 4% \ ‘ . ie aH m:% oo t- aes “ ag y) Se ¥: ida dt Be 4 rtide® aS bs > e [esa sas A ri raie yes Pests yp. wD _ ; $3 a ke I 4 Al "" ea, Pas — 1",53,0.74

He walked into the early hours on that cold dark and damp November night. James had left his hand written thoughts on a note pad on his bed. He never retumed, James made one last last and final decision in the darkness of that night and it became his permenant decision. 3 weeks later to the day, Levi on the right, my youngest son followed James's path and our lives were destroyed, It's like a nuclear bomb detonating in our living room, flattening, decimating and destroying everything that preceded it. I want to say this, as it is so relevant and such a compelling argument. Suicide will not take away your pain it will simply pass it on to those that are left behind. Words ‘of wisdom are “I would rather wipe away your tears and share you pain today than wheep myself and feel your the pain tomorrow. Suicide is always preventable, it's a permenant choice to a short term problem. ‘Asa public, community and a country we all need to pull together to stop this very preventable plague. The biggest killer men under 35 in the world. 2024 is likely to be the worst year for suicide in the UK for 2 decades. We all need to empathize with people that are in such devastating predicaments that they can't see any light. I can say now, that I am evidence that there is light, there is hope and there is future.
